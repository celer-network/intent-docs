# Introduction

Market makers are a critical component of the **Celer Intent** ecosystem. Each participating market maker can adopt its own pricing and execution strategy when responding to RFQs. Below, we provide the key resources needed to build and integrate a market maker with the protocol.

If you're interested in participating as a liquidity provider, please review the [**Celer Intent Market Maker SDK**](https://github.com/celer-network/intent-rfq-mm/blob/main/doc/sdk.md) and explore the provided [reference implementation](https://github.com/celer-network/intent-rfq-mm/blob/main/doc/mm.md). During the beta phase, onboarding is conducted via a whitelist process—fill out [this form](https://form.typeform.com/to/HqYNsiwA)to express interest and become one of the early market makers supporting Celer Intent.
